# Testing Linter

- In this project, the student builds an own customized linter for ruby files.
  The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented
  Programming gained in Microverse currriculum Ruby module.

# Getting Started

- This linter will parse your file and find some errors as defined by
  [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/github/rubocop-github/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md)

# Following can be tested with this linter

- Each line of code must be of a readable length. Unless you have a reason to,
  keep lines to a maximum of 118 characters. Why 118? That's the width at which
  the pull request diff UI needs horizontal scrolling (making pull requests
  harder to review).

- There should be no trailing whitespaces left.

- There should be spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons,
  around { and before }.

- There should be no spaces after (, [ or before ], ).

- There should be no spaces after !.

- There should be no unpaired |, (, ), {, }, [, ].

## Example of good code
``` ruby
sum = 1 + 2
a, b = 1, 2
1 > 2 ? true : false; puts "Hi"
[1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
```


``` ruby
some(arg).other
[1, 2, 3].length
```



``` ruby
!array.include?(element)
```
