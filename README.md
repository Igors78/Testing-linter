# Testing Linter
- In this project, the student builds an own customized linter for ruby files. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes, work with abstract syntax trees(AST).

# Getting Started
- This linter will parse your file and find any numbers except commonly used (like -10..10, 100 or 1000) and will suggest you to put a comment for this selected number in order to make code more understandable and to make possible to know context the number is used in. Mostly usable field is code for financial accountings, where changeable values and coefficients, like taxes or seasonal deductions are heavily used. Commenting numbers' context in these occasions will help you and other developers to understand with what case of quote, tax, percentage, constant or changeable value they have to deal with.
